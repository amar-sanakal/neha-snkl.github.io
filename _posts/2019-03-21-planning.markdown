To begin with, I'm no travel expert. I'm planning my gap year, and I decided to make this blog after a lot of meticulous research and a feeling that I was learning far too much about travel to keep it all to myself. If I can help anyone else with any of the travel tips I post here, I'll consider myself a success.

I've broken down travelling into all of the main aspects you need to think about when you want to explore somewhere new. Some of that is as free of charge as daydreaming or taking the initiative to Google the country that's caught your eye. Other parts, once you get deeper into your research, are where you have to strike the balance between what you want and what you're willing to spend. In other words, how much comfort, safety, and luxury do you need, and how much will you have to save up for that to happen? These vary from person to person. One person might not mind hitching a ride to whichever country their driver's headed towards, whereas another might get uncomfortable without a full itinerary with everything booked in advance so all they need to do is go and enjoy themselves. There's nothing wrong eith either approach or anything in between, but just from those two examples you can imagine the difference in budget our two travellers would need.

### Research:
This part is, as tedious as it can get, the part that you'll spend the most time on. Generally, the less time you spend on researching everything you're going to book, the more money you'll spend on the rest of the trip. This of course excludes intentionally planning less e.g. our earlier example of planning to hitch rides to see where you end up. We're assuming you've underplanned for a trip for which you booked flights, a hotel, etc. Doing more research will get you better deals.

### Packing:
Often overlooked, this element has become my favourite part of preparing for a trip. Don't leave it to the end! Your transport and accomodation will affect how light you'll need to pack more than you'd think, so think about reducing your load as early as possible. Make checklists of what you need, choose your bags carefully, and when it comes down to it, pack efficiently to make use of all of the space you've got. I've packed for a two week trip in a carry-on suitcase and a backpack before. It's a skill you'll be glad you learned.

### Transport:
So you've done your research, and you've got everything you need in your case.
