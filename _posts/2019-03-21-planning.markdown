To begin with, I'm no travel expert. I'm planning my gap year, and I decided to make this blog after a lot of meticulous research and a feeling that I was learning far too much about travel to keep it all to myself. If I can help anyone else with any of the travel tips I post here, I'll consider myself a success.

I've broken down travelling into all of the main aspects you need to think about when you want to explore somewhere new. Some of that is as free of charge as daydreaming or taking the initiative to Google the country that's caught your eye. Other parts, once you get deeper into your research, are where you have to strike the balance between what you want and what you're willing to spend. In other words, how much comfort, safety, and luxury do you need, and how much will you have to save up for that to happen? These vary from person to person. Some people don't mind hitching a ride to whichever country your driver's headed towards, whereas others get uncomfortable without a full itinerary with everything booked in advance so all they need to do is go and enjoy themselves. There's nothing wrong eith either approach or anything in between, but just from those two examples you can imagine the difference in budget our two travellers would need.
